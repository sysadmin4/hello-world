# hello-world
this is a short desc for my first repo (place to store a project)

Hey, Im doing some changes on my branch, as you can see.
(I'm gonna guess whats gonna happen next)
Then I'll commit them.
After that, I'll perform a Pull, that is:
    I will Pull changes from Master (if there were)
    Then I could have a conflict with another partner (which won't be the case).
    When everything's fine we go Next.
 And we perform a PUSH, that is:
  we PUSH our shiat to the Master Bracnh to make the changes effective.
    Ofc, in this case, we'll change the Push for a Merge.
      So basically, we'll rejoin the branches.
